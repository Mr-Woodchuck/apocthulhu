## Boilerplate System

This system built with the boilerplate system https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate that you can use as a starting point for building your own custom systems. It's similar to Simple World-building, but has examples of creating attributes in code rather than dynamically through the UI.
