# Apocthulhu System

This system is built for the APOCTHULHU System, unofficially. It is still in the works, but should be mostly functional.

## TODO

Things left undone so far

* Pushing sanity damage to bonds
*  Rolling on bonds
* Compendiums
 * skills
 * Archtypes
 * Bonds
 * Disorders
 * Temporary insanities
* Localization
 * Unfortunately I only speak English, but I should be able to get this to a place that others who do speak other languages can update a localization file for their language.

## Boilerplate System

This system built with the boilerplate system https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate that you can use as a starting point for building your own custom systems. It's similar to Simple World-building, but has examples of creating attributes in code rather than dynamically through the UI.
