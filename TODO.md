# Things to prioritize in what I'm going to fix here

1. Script/button for improving skills. Print out to chat
1. Sanity option for pushing to Bonds
1. Compendiums
  * Gear
    * Weapons
      * Might need a better way to tie to skill type.
      * Might be fine after default character setup. Needs more testing.
    * Items
      * I don't know what items might be in the SRD, would need to go look for that.
  * Default Character
    * Do I want a character generator Compendium/Method?
1. PC Motivation/Disorder redo
      * Not Effects
1. Localization
  * Probably going to be a long slow process.
